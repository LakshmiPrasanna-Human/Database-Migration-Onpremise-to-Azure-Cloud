Approach1: Azure Database Migration Service
Details: You can use Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the databases from an on-premises SQL Server instance to Azure SQL Database.
          It does this in online and offline migration. 
Offline Migration: application downtime starts when the migration starts. That means both On premise and Azure SQL servers would not be available to use.
Online Migration: downtime is limited to the time to cut over at the end of migration.
